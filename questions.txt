Question) I want to write a termination letter to the contractor and would love to study/research about the conditions on which the termination of the contract is done by EIC. Help me find 
the relevant clauses from the document?
2) In subject of labour laws and regulation, what were the different amendments introduced in the contract along with the replaced clause no?
